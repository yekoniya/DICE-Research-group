This notebook is our proposed machine learning model on the Cora dataset.

The Cora dataset consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes ("Case_Based", "Genetic_Algorithms", "Neural_Networks"
"Probabilistic_Methods", "Reinforcement_Learning", "Rule_Learning", "Theory"). 
The citation network consists of 5429 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a 0/1-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. The dictionary consists of 1433 unique words. 

To achieve our task we used a machine learning technique called Graph Neural Network. 
This notebook can be executed using Jupiter or google collab.
